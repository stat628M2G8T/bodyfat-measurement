This is a project about how to measure people's body fat. The measurement is based on a real data set of 252 men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements. And Body Fat can be measured by Body Density, however the measurement of Body Density is cumbersome and difficult. We want to find a simple, robust, accurate and precise “rule-of-thumb” method to predict percentage of Body Fat. 

#### Codes folder:
"bodyfat.R" contains the codes for data cleaning, variable selection and model analysis. "bodyfatcalculator" folder contains a shiny app that calculates body fat percentage based on abdomen and wrist.
